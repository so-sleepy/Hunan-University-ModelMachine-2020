# Hunan-University-ModelMachine-2020-

## a simple model machine, written in verilog language

This document is the final experiment of the 2020 electronic circuit course of Hunan University. Because the last experiment is to integrate the originally written modules, this file also contains the code file of the previous experiment. Due to the curriculum reform, this experiment is different from previous ones, using Verilog instead of VHDL. This document can be used as an experimental reference for electronic circuit course.
